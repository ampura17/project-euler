# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
In this project I will try to solve these problems over the course of my life, to exercise my programming skills.
All the problems can be found in the official website: https://projecteuler.net

## Naming system 
For example:
  euler-N.py 
  "N" - is the number of problem, which corresponds to the projecteuler website's archive.

Thank you!
Have a nice day!
